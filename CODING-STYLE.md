# Coding Style

Our project follows the [standard Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
with the following changes

- We allow up to 120 characters per line, please use all of the available space.

- Only capitalize the first letter of words/acronyms/abbreviations/initialisms when using
  CamelCasing for example it's `UiTest`, not `UITest`, `IsoMdocType`, not `ISOMDocType`,
  and so on.

## Exception Handling

- **Never catch `Throwable`:** `Throwable` is the root of the hierarchy and includes fatal
  system errors (like `OutOfMemoryError`). Catching it prevents the environment from terminating
  when it absolutely needs to, leading to corrupted state and unpredictable behavior.

- **Don't throw `Error`:** The `java.lang.Error` (or `kotlin.Error` which is type-aliased for
  when running on the JVM) class represents serious, unrecoverable problems that an application
  should generally not attempt to catch. Unlike standard exceptions, these typically indicate
  failures at the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) level or catastrophic system conditions. Use
  `IllegalStateException` or similar instead.

- **Avoid catching generic `Exception`:** Catching all exceptions acts as a black hole for
  standard developer bugs (like `NullPointerException` or `IllegalArgumentException`). This
  makes debugging extremely difficult because the application fails silently.

- **Catch specific exceptions:** Scope your `try-catch` blocks tightly and only catch the exact
  exceptions you anticipate and know how to recover from (e.g., `IOException` for network calls,
  or `JsException` for JavaScript interop boundaries).

- **Protect Coroutine Cancellation:** If you absolutely must catch a broad `Exception` (e.g., at a
  top-level boundary to prevent a crash), you **must** explicitly rethrow `CancellationException`.
  Failing to do so intercepts coroutine cancellation, breaking structured concurrency and causing
  memory leaks.
  ```kotlin
  catch (e: Exception) {
      if (e is CancellationException) throw e
      // Handle other exceptions safely
  }
  ```

* **Avoid standard `runCatching` with Coroutines:** Kotlin's built-in `runCatching {}` block
  catches `Throwable` under the hood. Do not use it around suspending functions unless you are
  using a custom wrapper that explicitly handles `CancellationException`.

* **Wrap `suspend` calls in `finally` blocks:** When a coroutine is cancelled, it throws
  a `CancellationException`. If you need to execute suspending cleanup code (like closing a
  connection or releasing a lock) inside a `finally` block, the coroutine is already in a
  cancelled state, and any standard `suspend` call will immediately fail. You must wrap the
  cleanup code in `withContext(NonCancellable)`.
  ```kotlin
  finally {
      withContext(NonCancellable) {
          // Suspending cleanup code goes here
      }
  }
  ```

* **Document exceptions in KDoc:** Every function or method must explicitly document the
  exceptions it throws using the `@throws` (or `@exception`) tag in its KDoc. This ensures that
  readers of the code know exactly what edge cases they are expected to handle.

* **Log exceptions:** When catching an exception, always log it using `Logger.e()` or `Logger.w()`
  depending on what is appropriate.
